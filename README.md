This is my (Jerome Sipin) submissino for the SQLAlchemy homework.

The analysis in Jupyter Notebook can be found in the provided
climate_starter.ipynb, where I have used Python to conduct the requested
analysis.

The file app.py contains the API portion of the assignment. For the 'set dates'
part of the API, the code only takes the format of YYYY-MM-DD, (for example:
  2021-08-26 for August 26, 2021).
